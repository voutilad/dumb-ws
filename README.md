I just need an integration shim for [chocolate-doom](https://github.com/voutilad/chocolate-doom) to talk to a data collector I'm going to run in "the cloud." Sadly, most cloud providers force you to use HTTP if you want to run in their "serverless" environments.

# ughhhhhh
Yeah, this in no way is going to be a fully [RFC-6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) compliant WebSocket client. Don't even bother.

Why would you even think of using this horrible mess? Fine, ISC.
